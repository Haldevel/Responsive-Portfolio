      <p>I am an experienced full stack software developer working in the Bay Area with a demonstrated history of working in the insurance industry. I also have a Masters degree with honors in Electrical Engeneering. In the past, I developed and supported custom ETL pipelines to process pending Acord standard XML files from multiple insurance carriers using Java and MS SQL Server. The application automated the work of multiple case specialists and included a web app administrator written in C# and JavaScript. The app enabled case specialists to manage pending policies, and allowed admins to navigate policy information individually or in aggregate, generate dynamic SSRS reports, navigate logs, receive alerts, and update policy details. 
        Some of my projects include building an automated email platform to manage all company daily email communications with medical vendors, APS vendors, and carriers using C#.
        I also developed .NET WCF web services and clients to function as communication channels for various medical and APS vendors to track case processes. </p>
